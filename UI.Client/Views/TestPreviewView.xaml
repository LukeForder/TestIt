                        Welcome to the I.T. Aptitude Assessment and Interest Analysis Tool, this tool will help you assess your
                        abilities and your interests with the field of I.T. The purpose of this tool is to assist you in making 
                        a decision as to whether you should pursue a career within I.T. Remember that the results of this 
                        assessment merely serve as an aid to your decision, they are not proscriptive, you are the one who should 
                        make the final choice.

                        This assessment focuses on two particular fields within the I.T. sector, namely Networking and Development.
                        The networking field focuses on the provision and maintenance of the hardware and network infrastructure
                        that has become crucial to the modern business environment. While the development field focuses on the
                        creation and maintenance of the software which assists in business practice. Bear in mind that the two
                        previous summaries are just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the career opportunities in each field,
                        we suggest that you go do research into the field that you interested in to gain understanding of what it entails.

                        The aptitude portion of the test focus to assessing your current level of skill within each field. While
                        previous experience isn’t necessary when studying it does help to at least have a basic understanding or
                        previous exposure to what you are studying as in some courses the work load is very heavy.
